        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>You really can't beat a classic tuna salad. As a kid, this recipe was often packed by my mom for school lunches. And as an adult, I often eat it wrapped in lettuce, sandwiched between gluten-free bread or served alongside my flaxseed crackers.  I also love tuna stuffed avocados for a tasty, low carb lunch - it's the best.</p>
            <p>It's incredibly easy to make with canned tuna and a few pantry staples - hooray for simple recipes! So if you're ever stuck in a lunch rut, having this basic recipe up your sleeve will definitely come in handy.</p>
